### Quotations on simplicity in software design
>  Remember that there is no code faster than no code.
>> --Taligent's Guide to Designing Programs  

&nbsp; 

> Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.
>> --Austin Freeman, "The Eye of Osiris"

&nbsp; 

> ...it is simplicity that is difficult to make.
>> -- Bertholdt Brecht

&nbsp; 
 
> The inherent complexity of a software system is related to the problem it is trying to solve. The actual complexity is related to the size and structure of the software system as actually built. The difference is a measure of the inability to match the solution to the problem.
>> -- Kevlin Henney, "For the sake of simplicity" (1999)

&nbsp; 
 
> The minimum could be defined as the perfection that an artefact achieves when it is no longer possible to improve it by subtraction. This is the quality that an object has when every component, every detail, and every junction has been reduced or condensed to the essentials. It is the result of the omission of the inessentials.
>> -- John Pawson, “Minimum” (1998)

&nbsp; 
 
> More good code has been written in languages denounced as "bad'' than in languages proclaimed "wonderful'' -- much more.
>>  -- Bjarne Stroustrup, "The Design and Evolution of C++" (1994)

&nbsp; 
 
>I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you looked at it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.
>> -- Poul Anderson

&nbsp; 
 
> Simple things should be simple and complex things should be possible.
>> -- Alan Kay

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 
 
> Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming.
>> -- C.A.R. Hoare

&nbsp;

>> -- Edsger W. Dijkstra, “The Humble Programmer” (1972)

&nbsp; 
 
> ... the cost of adding a feature isn't just the time it takes to code it. The cost also includes the addition of an obstacle to future expansion. ... The trick is to pick the features that don't fight each other.
>> -- John Carmack

&nbsp; 
 
> Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling --- the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration. Possibly this trend results from a mistaken belief that using a somewhat mysterious device confers an aura of power on the user.
>> -- Niklaus Wirth

&nbsp; 
 
> One of the most dangerous (and evil) things ever injected into the project world is the notion of process maturity. Process maturity is for replicable manufacturing contexts. Projects are one-time shots. Replicability is never the primary issue on one-time shots. More evil than good has come from the notion that we should "stick to the methodology." This is a recipe for non-adaptive death. I'd rather die by commission.
>> -- David Schmaltz

&nbsp; 
 
> The difference between a good and a poor architect is that the poor architect succumbs to every temptation and the good one resists it.

&nbsp; 
 
> If we complicate things they get less simple.
>> -- Professor at Cambridge University

>>  -- Nathaniel S. Borenstein

&nbsp; 
 
> Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment.
>> -- Frederick Brooks

&nbsp; 
 
> ...Simplifications have had a much greater long-range scientific impact than individual feats of ingenuity. The opportunity for simplification is very encouraging, because in all examples that come to mind the simple and elegant systems tend to be easier and faster to design and get right, more efficient in execution, and much more reliable than the more contrived contraptions that have to be debugged into some degree of acceptability....Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated.
>> -- Edsger W. Dijkstra

&nbsp;
